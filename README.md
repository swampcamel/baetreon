#### _A 0-backend all front-end clone of Patreon's site layout_

#### By Dan Mace


## Description
Baetreon is nearly a clone of the Patreon front page, as much as may be done in a single brief day.  Attempts to mimic layout, animations, colors, but especially for the practice of creating flex boxes and creating working media queries were all the purpose and intent for this project.  Below are comparisons of the two sites at different widths:

## Setup/Installation Requirements
- To view, visit https://swampcamel.github.io/baetreon
- To view locally, first go to https://github.com/swampcamel/baetreon.
- Click the green `Clone or download` button on the right, and select `Download ZIP`.
- Unzip `project-one-up-master.zip`.
- Navigate to the `project-one-up-master` directory.
- Inside `project-one-up-master` double-click on `index.html`.

## Known Bugs
- The layout for the benefits section wasn't designed to be easily manipulated with media queries, so it will need to be refactored.  To keep the site looking good on small devices, this section is removed at a certain max-width.
